== Day_1 ==
    HEY!!! How’s it goin’!!! Great to see a new food spot in town!!!
    That food in there smells GOOD. Can’t wait to try it!!!
    My name is ROXY. I was on my daily two mile jog and I saw a new store in town!!!
    I like my food HOT, you hear? Get to it!!!
-> DONE

== Day_2 ==
    GOOOOD morning! Working hard or hardly working? GAHAH!
*   How are you?
    I’m doing GREAT!!!
    My latest workout video BLEW UP!!! I’m almost at a million subscribers. Getting myself a POWER LUNCH to celebrate!
    You like working out? You should check out my channel! Turn those spaghetti noodle arms into PURE BEEF!!!
*   Got anything planned today?
    You KNOW IT! I’m on the grind train and I had the brakes removed!
    After FUELING UP here it's back to my studio. Gotta record a new workout video for my TubeYou channel!!!
    A consistent schedule is KEY TO GROWTH!!! Remember that! 

-   HAHA! Is that my food you’re cooking up? I can smell it! Cook faster little guy! Go! Go! Go!
-> DONE

== Day_3 ==
    Grrr...
    ...
    Huh? Oh, sorry. I’m all fired up today. Can’t think good.
*   What’s wrong?
    GRAAAH!!! My stupid mom!!! She doesn’t understand what I do at all!
    I showed her how good my TubeYou channel was going and she still went off on me about getting a ‘real job.’
    It IS a real job!!! I make workout videos so people can get RIPPED at home! And people LOVE my energy!
    It’s just as much a job as anything else, right!?
* *     Yeah!
        YEAH!!! You get it! She’s just too old fashioned..
        Wants me to come home and be someone's wife... but I’m married to the GAINS!!!
* *     Erm... I dunno..
        WHAT!? CMON!!! I put time and effort into my videos!
        I gotta make the workout routines, film them, edit the videos... It’s more than just looking AWESOME in front of a camera!!!
-   WHATEVER! I don’t need to think about all that. I need NUTRIENTS!
-> DONE

== Day_4 ==
    HEY!!! Something in that kitchen smells GOOD!!!
    I didn’t know they made food this tasty outside of Magma Mountain!!! But yours come PRETTY CLOSE!!!
*   Magma Mountain?
    YEAH!! That’s the region I come from!!!
    There’s a traditional ingredient from my hometown called Volcano Spice. It’s fiery hot flavor that’s UNMATCHED!!! Plus, it’s GREAT for pre workout meals!!!
    It’s just too hot for most people to handle... they don’t sell it at grocery stores... I only ever get to have it when I go home... 
    I’d give anything to taste that SWEET SWEET spice again! My mouth is watering just thinking about it!
    GAH!! Cook faster!!! My stomach is growling for some good eats!!!
-> DONE

== Day_5 ==
    Grrr... I’m OFF my GAME today...
    My videos keep getting raided with HATEFUL COMMENTS. I’ve gotta bunch gym bros telling me I’m doing things wrong..
    That I should go back to the kitchen... AWFUL THINGS... 
    What am I supposed to do!! My mojo is GONE.
*   Take a break!
    ... NO!!! I can’t do that!
    Give in to the haters by giving up. NO!!! I just CAN’T DO THAT!!!
    I’m going to work TWICE as hard to prove them wrong. You’ll see!!!
*   Prove them wrong!
    ... GRAH!! YOU’RE RIGHT!
    I can’t get down and sad about it! That’s just giving the HATERS what they WANT!!!
    Oh, I’m all FIRED UP now!!! Thanks, little buddy! I gotta keep PUSHING THROUGH!!!
-   I gotta get some grub before I get back on track. Double time, little guy!!!
-> DONE

== Day_6 ==
    HEY!!! How are you doin’? Cause I’m feeling GREAT!
    Just got back from a farmers market event!!! I got to teach a yoga class for all the local ladies.
    One of them recognized me from my TubeYou channel!!! She said my videos helped her feel more CONFIDENT in herself!!! It was COOL.
    I get comments all the time from ladies saying that my videos help them. But hearing a testimonial in person is a WHOLE NEW FEELING!
    She gave me some cookies from her booth!!! I never knew Oatmeal Cookies could taste SO GOOD!!!
*   Oatmeal cookies?
    UH HUH! I’m not usually a cookie fan, but those cookies were GOOD!
    The flavor of the oatmeal with the sweetness of the cookie... DELICIOUS!
    And they’re healthy too!!! I wish I brought some of them with me!!
*   Yoga class?
    YEAH! I do more than pump iron.
    Yoga is good for your SOUL. Gets the blood FLOWING.
- -> DONE

== Day_7 ==
    Hey!!! Guess what?
    I’m gonna be going back to my hometown at the end of the month. It’s my moms BIRTHDAY!!!
    I’m not stoked about it. But FAMILY comes FIRST!!!
*   How's your mom?
    She! Is! Fine!
    . . .
    Last time we talked! We had a FIGHT!!!
    Just how families are back home. But she wanted me to go off and get MARRIED... wants grandkids and all that.
    But I’m an INDEPENDENT WOMAN! I’m starting my own fitness empire!!! No time for all that!!!
    Even though we don’t see eye to eye... I still LOVE MY MOM!!!
*   How’s your town?
    My hometown is... HOT!!!
    The people there live very differently than here... You get a husband, have kids, take care of them, get old... GRAHHH!!!
    Maybe that’s the life other people want. But that’s not the one I want!!!
    I want to help people get JACKED!!!
-   GRAAH... Thinking too hard is hurting my head.. I need a meal to think over!!!
-> DONE

== Day_8 ==
    Grr... GRAHHH!!!
    Some band of LOSERS has been SPAMMING my socials with hate comments..
    I won’t read these awful posts. But I can’t TAKE it anymore!
    I can bench press TWICE as much as these meatheads! Why are they so threatened that a lady is stronger than them?
    I’m just trying to help ladies feel GOOD about themselves!!! Why is that such a problem!!!
    They don’t even have the courage to say it to my FACE!!!
    Grr... I gotta clear my head... Maybe I’ll post about the nasty comments!!! Tell people to KNOCK IT OFF!!
-> DONE

== Day_9 ==
    Sniff sniff...
*    What’s wrong?
    GAH! Oh, it’s you. I was busy READING...
    I made a video addressing the NASTY COMMENTS I’ve been getting... I thought it might only make it worse...
    But all the ladies that follow me have been commenting REALLY NICE THINGS!! Sniff. Sniff.
    “You helped me believe in myself.” “I wouldn’t have been able to start getting healthier without your videos.” “You have to keep going, your workouts help me stay energized!”
    I think once my mom sees all these supportive comments, she’ll see my side!! She’ll see how AWESOME the fitness community can be!!!
    GRAAAH!! That settles it! I’m going home tonight, and I won’t leave until she understands that I NEED to do this!!!
    Thanks for all the help, little guy!!!
-> DONE

== Day_10 ==
    HEY little buddy!
    Just got back from Magma Mountain!
*    How’d it go with your mom?
    It went... BETTER THAN I EXPECTED!!!
*    How’d it go with your dad?
    Huh?... Get the wax out of your ears!!! I was visiting my MOM!!!
-   We talked for a long time. She tried convincing me to stay home, said I should be focused on starting a family.
    She told me she didn’t understand my job. But I wouldn’t back down!!! I told her about what I do!!!
    We did one of my workouts together! She was hesitant at first but by the end of it she was SMILING!!!
    Then I showed her all the NICE COMMENTS from my channel!!! And she looked... so... PROUD!!! 
    I think she finally understood!!! She told me to get back out there and to never give up!!! GAHAH!!
    So today I’m celebrating!!! Celebrating with a delicious meal!!! 
-> DONE
